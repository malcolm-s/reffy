Ideas
- more models
- approval of referendums
- admin separation
- email confirmation on register
- user roles
- integrate with something on register (like a government service to check that an ID matches)
- logic around referendums (dates can vote, can only vote once)
- more validation of forms

Interesting ideas
- caching

Maybe useful ideas
- background jobs
- message queue / spring integration
- tests
- test coverage

Meh ideas
- css (tailwind?) (black and white) (text heavy)

Frustrating waste of time
- migrations

Done
- csrf
- results page for referendums
- conditional beans
- transactions
- application events
- authentication
- more models
- scheduled tasks
- form validation
- thymeleaf layouts
